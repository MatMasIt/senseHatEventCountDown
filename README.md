# senseHatEventCountDown

A SenseHat based event countdown timer


Just edit the code and see a pixel-based countdown

Default pixels colors:

- ![#FFFF00](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FFFF00/000000?text=+) Years
- ![#FF69B4](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FF69B4/000000?text=+) Months
- ![#00FF00](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00FF00/000000?text=+) Days
- ![#0000FF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/0000FF/000000?text=+) Hours
- ![#FF0000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FF0000/000000?text=+) Minutes
- ![#FFFFFF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FFFFFF/000000?text=+) Seconds

There are two mode

- `0` Alternate matrix display to show all the pixels stacked
- `1` Only show the highest time unit's pixels

Seconds are shown as a marquee message in a 60s countdown when approaching the event

The script closes when the datetime is reached

This will be tested at this new year's eve

I will report to you how it palyed out
